He incises the pulmonary valve leaflets at their junction and removes anything obstructing blood flow through the ventricular outflow tract.
33688,The provider closes a hole in the septum (wall) between the ventricles with a patch or sutures to prevent the mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. He removes a pulmonary artery band from a previous surgery to temporarily treat a ventricular septal defect. He may add a gusset to reinforce the patch on the pulmonary artery.
33697,The provider closes off the ventricular septal defect with a patch graft and places a tube graft between the right ventricle and pulmonary artery. This bypasses the obstruction of blood flow that the underdevelopment or absence of the pulmonary valve causes.
33724,"The provider incises the chest wall and repairs an isolated partial anomalous pulmonary venous return (PAPVC), a congenital condition in which one or more of the pulmonary veins fail to reach the left atrium of the heart, instead it drains oxygenated blood from the lungs into the right atrium of the heart by way of an abnormal, or anomalous, connection."

33750,"In this procedure, the provider surgically creates a shunt between the subclavian and the pulmonary artery. A shunt forms the bypass channel or passageway in the blood circulation connecting two blood vessels and diverts blood from one region to the other. The aim of this procedure is to improve oxygenation of the blood in a patient with cyanosis from insufficient pulmonary, or lung, blood flow due to a congenital heart defect. The provider performs this procedure as a temporary measure until he can perform another procedure to correct the actual heart defect. This procedure is also known as a Blalock Taussig operation."
33755,"In this procedure, the provider surgically creates a shunt between the ascending aorta and the pulmonary artery.

33767,"In this procedure, the provider surgically creates a shunt between the superior vena cava and the right pulmonary artery diverting deoxygenated blood directly to both the lungs. A shunt forms the bypass channel or passageway in the blood circulation connecting two blood vessels and diverting blood from one region to the other.

This procedure is also known as bidirectional Glenn procedure."
33770,"In this procedure, the provider repairs a cardiac defect present from birth, in which the aorta arises from the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery arises from the left ventricle. This causes problems in circulation of oxygenated blood in the body. The provider switches the aorta and the pulmonary artery to their normal positions without the need to enlarge the hole in the ventricular septum. The provider also removes an obstructive band of fibrous muscle present at the tip of pulmonary artery."
33771,"In this procedure, the provider surgically repairs a cardiac defect present from birth, in which the aorta arises from the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery arises from the left ventricle.

In this procedure the provider must also repair a narrowing of the pulmonary artery, a blood vessel that carries deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle to the lungs for purification."
33782,"In this procedure, the provider moves the aortic root to the pulmonary position, excises the pulmonary valve, and reconstructs the ventricular outflow tracts. The provider repairs the blood vessels to allow proper circulation of blood in a patient with a ventricular septal defect. He also repairs a pulmonary artery stenosis, or narrowing. The provider does not perform a coronary ostium reimplantation."
33783,"In this procedure, the provider moves the aortic root to the pulmonary position, excises the pulmonary valve, and reconstructs the ventricular channels.

33803,"The provider surgically repairs an aberrant vessel, or a vessel having an unusual course or origin, by dividing it and removing any constricting fibrous bands, which may be hampering the normal blood flow through the vessel. The provider also performs reanastomosis in which he reconnects the anomalous, or abnormal artery with other arteries."
33851,"The provider excises tissues, which are narrowing the aorta of the patient. He may also repair a patent ductus arteriosus if present. For the repair, the provider either uses the left subclavian artery or a synthetic material called a prosthesis."

The provider may use a prosthesis to the level of the celiac artery origin. This procedure does not include repair of the left subclavian artery origin."
33886,"The provider places an extension prosthesis in the descending aorta using a guidewire. He commonly performs this procedure to repair an endoleak in the descending thoracic aorta that had been previously grafted due to an aneurysm, pseudoaneurysm, dissection, penetrating ulcer, intramural hematoma, or traumatic disruption. These endoleaks are due to an exclusion of the aneurysm, which causes backflow of blood into the aneurysm."

33928,The provider removes a previously placed artificial heart and implants a new one as a temporary measure until a donor heart is found or for patients who are not eligible for a heart transplant and require permanent mechanical cardiac support. The replaced artificial heart may have failed or a newer model may be required for other reasons.

He inspects the heart, and excises or sutures the blood vessels, if they need repair, and removes any blood clots. He examines the lungs and removes any pericardial tissue he finds on the lungs. He also excises the trachea, or windpipe, to the necessary length."
33949,"In this procedure, the provider handles the daily management of a veno–arterial (VA) ECMO or ECLS circulation for a patient who was previously placed on extracorporeal circulation where the blood that drains from the venous system is returned to the venous system.

A PET scan provides a three–dimensional image of the body that makes it easy to detect the presence of a malignant tumor. Cancer cells have a higher metabolic rate than normal body cells and a PET scan takes advantage of this while imaging. The patient is injected with a radiopharmaceutical tracer called FDG (fluoro–deoxyglucose, a radioactive substance containing glucose) one hour prior to the scheduled imaging. The radiotracer spreads throughout the body through the blood stream and gets absorbed by cells and starts emitting small amounts of energy (positrons). The positrons collide with electrons resulting in the production of photons that travel in opposite directions. The photon emission is captured by the PET scanner and processed with a computer to produce a three–dimensional image of the body tissues. Cancerous cells show a high radiotracer uptake and are highly visible in the scan in comparison to healthy cells."
78816,"The patient is injected with a radiopharmaceutical tracer called FDG (fluoro–deoxyglucose, a radioactive substance containing glucose) about one hour before the imaging is scheduled to begin. The radiotracer spreads in the body via the blood stream and gets absorbed by cells and starts emitting small amounts of energy (positrons). The positrons collide with electrons resulting in the production of photons that travel in opposite directions. The photon emission is captured by the PET scanner and is processed in a computer to give a three–dimensional image of the body tissues being studied. Cancerous cells display a high radiotracer uptake and are highly visible in the scan in comparison to healthy cells. But the PET scan has a limitation in terms of pinpointing the location of a tumor. This shortcoming is overcome by the combination of a PET and CT. The CT scan produces thin cross–sectional slices of internal organs. The images produced by the PET and the CT are combined together to obtain accurate details about the size and location of a tumor. Images can be obtained for the whole body or for any limited area of the body."

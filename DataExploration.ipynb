    "With hosptials and clinics contributing to half of total health spending in the US, it would be beneficial to track the expense breakdowns of these facilities. I anticipate this data containing over 10 years of hospital charge history to be used to determine the cost of medical attention on the procedural level, and compare these price changes against other health expenditures. For instance, comparing the cost of hospital expenses with presciption medicine, nursing care, or dental care, and finding the distibution of total healthcare expenses per year across these categories. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, as out-of-pocket expenses and health insurance premiums continue to increase, it would be more efficient for patients to understand the cost of their healthcare needs prior to hospital admission. Data analysts could reveal the actual costs of these procedures and identify the gaps between health insurance coverage and hosptial charges. The data could also be used to compare the prices between hopsitals on the same procedures so patients would have a more hollistic understanding before seeking medical service. \n",
    "\n",
    "On a more general view, the hopsital charge data could also be used in the public health sector to find out how medical costs vary across different regions. It could reveal how the average income, tax rate, or overall population health could affect the resulting cost of the same procedure in differnt cities."
